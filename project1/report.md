## Cryptosystem Analysis
say sth about its property, 
1. is it perfect secret when scheduling algorithm is modular of plaintext position?
2. under what assumption, it's perfect secret?

## Observations

Same analysis with [README.md](project1/README.md)

when the input size is smaller than what, the DFS algorithm is efficient?

## Algorithm desc & impl

## results
refactor logger function

chart with variables:
1. word number
2. fault tolerances distribution
3. sub dictionaries distribution
...

## performance analysis
refactor logger function and analysis
