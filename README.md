## Build Environments
```
       cmake: 3.4.1
c++ standard: c++11
    compiler: Apple LLVM version 7.0.2 (clang-700.1.81)
```
Standard is chosen as `c++11` to take the advantage of compatibility.
It should also compiles for `g++` or `msvc`.

## Libraries
`gtest` and `CppQuickCheck` were chosen. `gtest` will be used to test
pre-conditions and post-conditions. And `CppQuickCheck` will be used to
auto generating test samples (e.g. keys & ciphertexts).

I think I could build up this test framework before Feb 21. So don't worry
about it.

## Current Project
Please refer to [project1](project1/README.md) for the project task.
